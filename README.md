# Cardio Risk Cleaning & Exploration

This repository provides a lightweight preprocessing pipeline for the **Cardio** classification dataset. It loads the raw CSV, performs basic feature engineering/validation, writes out a cleaned dataset, and generates a few exploratory figures that help sanity-check the data before modeling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 (or compatible)
- Recommended: create a virtual environment (the project keeps its dependencies in `requirements.txt`)

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

The script:

1. Loads `Dataset/cardio_train.csv` (semicolon-delimited).
2. Cleans implausible records and engineers `age`, `bmi`, and `pulse_pressure`.
3. Writes `Dataset/cardio_clean.csv`.
4. Saves quick-look figures under `Dataset/figures/`.
5. Prints shape/column info and class-balance statistics.

If you prefer to re-run the pipeline from scratch, delete the generated files (`cardio_clean.csv`, the `figures/` directory) and run `python main.py` again.
